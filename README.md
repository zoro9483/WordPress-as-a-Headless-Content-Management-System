# WordPress-as-a-Headless-Content-Management-System
basic web application architecture that is involved with setting up a headless WordPress site.
A WordPress application is made of three key components:

A web-server
The file system
The database

The WordPress hosting company, FlyWheel, has a tool called Local which I use exclusively for all my WordPress development. With a few clicks a web-server is configured, the files downloaded and the database prepared for you.
